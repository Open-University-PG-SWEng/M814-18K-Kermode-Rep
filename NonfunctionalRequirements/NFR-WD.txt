[NW] - Good amount of detail WD, although I dont think customers will be very happy with 'ensure . . . customer account "is" compromised', your criterion seems fine although I'm not familiar with the ISO quoted, was that in the module? minor spelling mistake in your description needs editing too.

[DIA] - This seems like a good requirement with a very clear requirement, I am not familure with ISO 27001, but I would expect that because the system handles credit/debit cards that it would be a requirement to adhear to the PCI-DSS security standard as well.

[JG] We should state that the system has been 'certified to comply' with ISO/IEC 27001, rather than just 'complying'.

[WD] - Updated fit criterion based on comments by JG and DIA to strengthen Fit Criterion in relation to compliance with regulations and provide a testable element - 09/03/2019 @ 20:10
