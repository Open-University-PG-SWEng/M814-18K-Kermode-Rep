[PJ] I would question whether this is a performance requirement or even a non-functional requirement at all. To me, it reads more like a functional requirement for the schedule that is required to run every 24 hours. Focusing on the fit criterion, for a performance NFR in this area, I would expect a metric that stipulates something like a maximum length of time to run a schedule rather than the frequency the schedule will run at. An example would be "When the reallocated waiting list is updated, it takes no longer than 2 seconds to update a list of 1000 tickets".

[NW] Maybe a better way to phrase your discription would be 'Reallocation of tickets on the waiting list shall be updated within/no longer than 24 hrs'? The waiting list its self can do nothing [its just a list]. Could be functional as suggested but I think it just needs some rewording, your fit criterion isnt terrible it just needs to fit the description better, as suggested by PJ it needs a definite measurable metric to be testable.
[SH] I like the fit criterion now. But now the rationale needs updating to meet the new fit criterion. Why is it we want to ensure the reallocation takes no more than 3 seconds? I would suggest it is more for the benefit of the systems performance then the customers wait times
