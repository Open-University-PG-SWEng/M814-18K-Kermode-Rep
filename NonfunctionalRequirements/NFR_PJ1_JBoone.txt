REQ-ID: NFR_PJ1
Description: The product shall keep a history of all un-allocation activities for a single ticket, for the statutory period, and no more.
Type: Non-functional Performance Type 12 and Security Requirements Type 15
Rationale: Prior unallocation data may be needed for fraud investigation, customer disputes, or audit trail.
Fit Criterion: The product shall track up to 1000 un-allocation events for a single ticket, for only the duration of the statutory data retention period, and be able to return that volume of data in a formatted manner.

Comment:[AM01]I would think this NFR is also a security Type because you mentioned data of unallocation activities.
[MG] I think the fit criterion "track up to 1000 un-allocation events for a single ticket" and "be able to return [1000]" event data would be testable; but I'm struggling to imagine the circumstances in which a single ticket would be unallocated more than once, let alone 1000 times (although I hesitate to pre-empt any design).
[JB] Added in Security NFR type and edited Rationale and Fit Crterion to reflect the change.
[DIA] I would be surprised that 1000 un-allocation events happened, but I also find that it is odd to place a limit like this on a design, I like the use of statutary data retention period, but I am not clear what this time is.
