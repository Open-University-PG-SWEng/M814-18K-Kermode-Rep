REQ-ID: ND3
Description: The product shall encrypt UID (Unique Identifier) [for tickets] in Katakana (unicode in DB)
Type: Security
Rationale: A hacker might [brute force] attack using english dictionary file as JTT is a british system
Fit Criterion: The average hacker shall be unable to access ticket information due to this unexpected encryption

[MG] I don't think the fit criterion is testable as "The average hacker" is undefined. Is there a time-limit or limit to attempts that can be placed cracking an encrypted data item? If these are exceeded then the encryption works - though you can't guard against chance, no matter how small.
[RJE 7th March 2019: The requirement description does sound like a solution to me, perhaps this wouldn't be the case if it had only mentioned encrypting the product ID and not having to use the Katakana syllabary ? Perhaps the fit criteria would be more quantifiable if it stated that the Software Masters security consultant should be unable to access the ticket ID within a certain period of time, or even the ticket ID should be encrypted to the Software Masters company security standards (assuming they have these) ]
