REQ-ID:NFR-TP2
Description: The allocation of returned tickets should be easily monitored every 24 Hrs by Thomas and Polly.
Type: Reliability and availability
Rationale: To enable Thomas and Polly to easily monitor the return situation and promptly highlight fraud patterns. 
Fit Criterion: The system should present the results of the returned tickets clearly and on a daily basis to Thomas and Polly.
Originator: Polly 
Comments: 
[TP] Being an online system an easy target for frauds, this feature should highlight eventual patterns to Thomas and Polly, maybe showing on a daily basis statistics about the number of tickets returned, and the names of the persons that have purchased them in first and then in second instance.
[KC] Another possible option would be to keep track of the number of times the same card details have been used for purchases and returns and flagging any strange patterns from there.
