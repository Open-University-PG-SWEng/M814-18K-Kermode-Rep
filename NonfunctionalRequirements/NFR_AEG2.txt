REQ-ID: NFR_AEG2
Description: The allocation process must run in parallel with the other ticket inquiries and purchase processes without halting or slowing down the system.  
Type: NFR
Rationale: This will allow users to search for and purchase tickets as usual when the reallocation process is running. 
Fit Criterion: The ticket reallocation process shall be isolated and configured to run with low priority so that it does not halt or slow down the system when the system is experiencing high traffic of over 200 concurrent users.
Originator: AEG
Comments: [AEG] added a non-functional requirment for the AEG2 functiional requirement
[PJ] For the fit criterion, I think "traffic of over 200 concurrent users" is too vague. QA could legitimately test this using 2,000,000 concurrent users (or more) and raise a bug if the system slowed down. I would be more specific (i.e. "traffic of 250 concurrent users").
