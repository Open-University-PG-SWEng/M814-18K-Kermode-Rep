[MG 20190315] The Fit Criterion as it stands can be tested. It may be further improved by specifying that (e.g.) 98% of tickets are returned correctly. 
[NW 20190315] I agree fit can be tested but would suggest rewording - I liked the fact you used numbers, as measureable and you use shall so well done 
there, I would just suggest 'differentiate between their individually owned tickets' just to be clear that their not seeing any other customers tickets. 
I also agree with MG's comments
