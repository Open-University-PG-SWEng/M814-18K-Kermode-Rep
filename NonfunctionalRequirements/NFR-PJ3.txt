REQ-ID:PJ3
Description:A ticket can only be added to the list to re-allocate by the automated process processing the returned ticket
Type:Non-Functional Requirement - Security - Access
Rationale:To avoid the risk of tickets being re-allocated fraudulently
Fit Criterion:The principle of least privilege is applied to the re-allocation list and process. Only the account the automated process is running under is given permission to add ticket details to the re-allocation list.
Originator: Security Expert at Software Masters
Comments: [M814-ModuleChair] Add comments below, making sure to include your initials in [] at the start.
[PJ] I have assumed that there will be an assigned security expert at software masters responsible for identifying non functional security requirements.
[WD] In relation to 'only the account .. is given permission', this statement appears vague and leaves it open to interpretation of what account level is authorised to run the automated. Inclusion of perhaps a specific account-type would remove the ambiguity as 'account' could be conceived as being from any level that can access the system and specifying the account level would strengthen the Fit Criterion.
